Changes from RapidMiner 5.2.8 to 5.3.0
--------------------------------------
* Development JDK was switched to Java 7 but code still is compatible with Java 6.
* Added new and improved extensive documentation (often including tutorial processes) for almost all operators
* Added improved RapidAnalytics support. New run button: "Run process on RapidAnalytics".
  Can only be used if the process is stored on a RapidAnalytics repository.
  Instantly runs the process on the RapidAnalytics server the process is stored on
* Connecting ports in reverse order is possible now (Input port -> output port)
* Run on RapidAnalytics-Dialog can choose execution queue
* New operators: Create Archive File and Add Entry to Archive File allow to create zip files
* New operator: Performance to Data
* New operator: Throw Exception
* New file system operators: Copy File, Move File, Delete File, Rename File, Create Directory
* New operators for handling annotations: Annotate, Annotations to Data, Data to Annotations, Extract Macro from Annotation
* Aggregate: new aggregation functions: sum (fractional), count (fractional), count (percentage) and string concatenation
* Execute Program operator has File Object ports for stdin, stdout, stderr
* Loop Attributes: new output port which collects the data from all iterations 
* Macros can be passed through the command line. Example: 'rapidminer //repository/home/test/process -Mkey1=value "-Mkey2=value with spaces"' will provide two macros named key1 and key2
* Result Perspective: Added button in top right corner of a result tab to close all open results at once
* Repositories View: Added button which navigates to the repository location of the currently opened process
* Repositories View: Added popup menu item to open the selected entry in the OS file browser (only for Local Repositories)
* Added new view: 'Macros': This view shows macros and their values in real time during process execution
* More consistent handling of input sinks and output sinks of processes and subprocesses:
>(1)Sinks can be moved up or down by dragging them with the left mouse key while shift key is pressed
>(2)Removed double click on process input sink, all actions on process sinks can now be trigged via a popup menu
* Added resize button to text parameter editor dialog
* Added resize button to text parameter editor dialog
* Preferences menu buttons reworked: 'OK' button saves settings permanently and closes the dialog; 
  'Apply' button saves settings permanently and does not close the dialog
* Generate Data: warn user if the selected number of attributes is not supported by the target function
* The RM window title now shows the complete location of the current process to avoid confusion with multiple processes with the same name
* Trying to create a new process/open another process/exit RM while a process is running now requires user confirmation
* Local repositories which are inaccessible for any reason now have an annotation which shows that they are inaccessible
* 'Remote' repositories are now called 'RapidAnalytics' repositories.
* Plugin loading: when loading manually installed plugins from the webstart or plugins folder with multiple versions, 
  load the one with the highest version number
* Added database metadata caching to improve performance. If you need to clear the cache, 
  use the menu item 'Clear Database Metadata Cache' under the 'Tools' menu.
* Declare Missing Values: allow to declare an empty string as missing, and ignore attributes which are not compatible to the selected mode.
* Extract Macro: added optional list parameter to add unlimited macro name/value pairs when 'macro type' is set to 'data_value'.
* 'Synchronize Meta Data with Real Data' toggle button added in the top right corner of the process view.
  This will now propagate the real meta data to all reached input ports after process execution.
  This means that for example the operator after a breakpoint will have its meta data synched with the real data, therefore 
  enabling e.g. attribute selection parameters to show the list of paramters available.
  Known Issue: Currently this information is lost once the operator updates itself, which happens for example if you deselected/select it again.
* Loop Until: Added 2 checkboxes in order to choose whether you want a condition check depending on the example set or on the performance.
  'condition before' is now deselected by default.
* Select Parameters Dialog: Parameters from type ParameterTypeString are now treated like numerical Parameters (the Grid option is enabled now), in case
  you want to assign a row of numerical values to a String Parameter.
* Select Parameters Dialog: All acceptable parameter types are now shown, even if the continuous/discrete mode is enabled.
* Regular Expression Dialog: Dialog has a new tab: Regex Options. In this tab, the user can define options like multiline mode or
  case-insensitive matching. These options will be added to the pattern though embedded flag expressions.
* Added new shortcut to toggle the breakpoint before an operator (Shift+F7)
* Improved many error messages
* Update Dialog: Revamped update dialog to show various lists of packages (search,  most popular, bookmarks, etc. as well as functionality to log in/out)
* Added a startup check for purchased but not installed extensions and a property to disable the check. Those Extensions can be directly installed from the dialog.  
* RapidMiner enters safe mode (not loading plugins) when startup was interrupted
* Added new 'Export as PDF' action to the 'Print results or export' dropdown button
* Deleted tooltips for the operator list of the OptimizeParameters (Grid) operator
* UpdateDialog: Switched the positions of the install button and the link to the extension homepage
* UpdateDialog: Checks if the user purchased the extension when returning to the dialog after hitting the "purchase" button
* Replaced the standard Random function in the ExpressionParser with a custom one in order to involve the random seed/the RandomGenerator for the process    
* Updated JTDS driver to version 1.2.5
* Loop Collection Operator has new parameters: 'set iteration macro', 'macro name' and 'macro start value'
* Execute Process Operator: inverted the default values for all boolean parameters
* Repository names now enforce a blacklist of invalid characters
